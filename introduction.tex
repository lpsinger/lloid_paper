The coalescence of compact binary systems consisting of neutron stars (NS)
and/or black holes (BH) is the most promising source of gravitational radiation
for Advanced \LIGO~\cite{ALIGOWeb}, Virgo~\cite{AVirgoWeb}, \GEO~\cite{GEOWeb},
and \LCGT~\cite{LCGTWeb}.  Tens of binary coalescence events are expected to be
observed in the advanced detector era later this
decade~\cite{Abadie:2010p10836}.

As a compact binary system loses energy to gravitational waves, its orbital
separation decreases. This causes a run-away inspiral with the
gravitational-wave amplitude and frequency increasing until the system
eventually merges near the innermost stable circular orbit (\ISCO).  If a
neutron star is involved it may become tidally disrupted near the merger.  This
disrupted matter can fuel a bright electromagnetic counterpart in the system's
final moments as a binary~\cite{shibata:2007}.

Prompt electromagnetic emission can arise as shells of relativistically
outflowing matter collide in the inner shock. Such an inner shock from a
compact binary coalescence is believed to be the mechanism of short gamma-ray
bursts~\cite{nakar07}. This prompt emission is a probe into the extreme initial
conditions of the outflow. A very bright optical flash should accompany the
x-rays and gamma-rays~\cite{Sari99}. \editorial{Should mention that optical
flashes have been seen for a handful of long GRBs by very fast slews. TAROT has
seen many within ~20 seconds. \cite{Klotz09}} In contrast, an afterglow is
produced when the outflow impacts the interstellar medium.  Afterglows
represent lower Lorentz factors and the conditions of the environment far
outside of the central engine, and are relatively insensitive to initial
conditions. In order to observe the most intense electromagnetic emission and
provide an unbroken chain of observations between the progenitor system and the
expanding fireball, telescopes must point during the seconds surrounding the
merger.

\editorial{Citation needed for LOOC-UP} The gravitational-wave community
initiated a project to send alerts when potential gravitational-wave transients
are observed.  In October 2010, \textsc{ligo} completed its sixth science run
(S6) and Virgo completed its third science run (VSR3).  While both
\textsc{ligo} detectors and Virgo were operating, several all-sky detection
pipelines operated in a low-latency configuration, namely \textsc{mbta}, ihope,
Coherent WaveBurst, and Omega~\cite{HugheyGWPAW2011, S6lowlatency}.
\editorial{Get references for these low-latency pipelines.} The S6 analysis
achieved latencies of 30--60 minutes, which were dominated by a human vetting
process. Candidates were sent for electromagnetic followup to several
telescopes; Swift, \textsc{rotse}, \textsc{tarot}, and Zadko~\cite{kanner2008,
HugheyGWPAW2011} took images of likely sky locations.  \textsc{mbta} achieved
the best gravitational-wave trigger generation latencies of 2--5 minutes.  We
assume that in the advanced detector era the vetting process will be automated,
so current trigger generation and telescope actuation would then dominate
latency.

To this end, we have the ambition of reporting candidates not minutes
\emph{after} the merger, but seconds \emph{before}.  By looking for threshold
crossings before the signal leaves the detection band, it is possible to trade
some signal to noise ratio (\textsc{snr}) for latency.  Figure
\ref{fig:earlywarning} shows projected early trigger rates for NS--NS binaries
in Advanced \LIGO\ assuming the event rate predictions in
\cite{Abadie:2010p10836}.

\caption{\label{fig:earlywarning} Expected number of NS--NS sources that will
be detectable $T_\mathrm{bc}$ seconds before coalescence.  The solid line is the most
likely yearly rate estimate $N_{\mathrm{re}}$ for Advanced \LIGO\ and the
shaded region is the interval $N_{\mathrm{low}}$ to $N_{\mathrm{high}}$ from
\cite{Abadie:2010p10836}.  Note that assuming \SNR\ 8 is sufficient for
detection and that we observe $N_{\mathrm{re}} = 40$ events per year with a
detector having the ZERO\_DET\_high\_P noise model described
in~\cite{ALIGONoiseZERO_DET_high_P}, $\sim10$ sources may be detected within 10
seconds of merger and $\sim1$ sources maybe detected within 100 seconds of
merger.  Other noise models, ZERO\_DET\_low\_P~\cite{ALIGONoiseZERO_DET_low_P}
and BHBH\_20deg~\cite{ALIGONoiseBHBH_20deg} provide better results for early
detection but at the cost of fewer total events observed above SNR 8.}

Predictive detection of \CBC{}s will require striking a balance between latency
and throughput.  \CBC{} searches consist of banks of matched filters, or
cross-correlations between the data stream and a bank of nominal ``template''
signals.  There are many different implementations of matched filters, but most
have high throughput at the cost of high latency, or low latency at the cost of
low throughput.  The former are epitomized by the overlap-save algorithm for
\textsc{fft} convolution, currently the preferred method in gravitational wave
searches.  The most obvious example of the latter is the time domain
(\textsc{td}) convolution, which is has no latency at all.  However, its
computational complexity is quadratic in the length of the templates, so it is
prohibitively expensive for long templates.

Fortunately, the morphology of inspiral signals can be exploited to offset some
of the computational complexity of low latency algorithms.  First, the signals
evolve slowly in frequency, so that they can be broken into contiguous
bandlimited time intervals and processed at possibly lower sample rates.
Second, inspiral filter banks consist of highly similar templates, admitting
principal component analysis to reduce the number of templates.  We described a
rank reduction scheme based on singular value decomposition in
\cite{Cannon:2010p10398}.  We will use both aspects to demonstrate that a very
low latency analysis with predictive detection of compact binary sources is
possible with current computing resources.  Assuming other aspects of
gravitational-wave observation latency can be reduced significantly, this
should allow the possibility for prompt alerts to be sent to the astronomical
community.

The paper is organized as follows. First we provide an overview of our method
for detecting compact binary coalescence signals in an \earlywarning\ analysis.
We then describe the pipeline we have constructed that implements our method.
To validate the approach we present results of simulations and conclude with
some remarks on what remains to prepare for the Advanced detector era.
