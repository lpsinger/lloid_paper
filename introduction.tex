However, the computational requirements of conventional detection strategies --- especially those that are well suited to low latency applications --- will be greatly increased by this upgrade for two reasons.  First, advanced detectors will have much improved low-frequency sensitivity, so chirp signals from coalescing binaries will remain in the detectors' band for longer.  This will demand that matched filter based searches use longer templates, requiring more memory and more cycles to process.  Second, background noise for advanced detectors will be more spectrally uniform, so it will be possible to resolve the intrinsic parameters of a source that determine the time-frequency structure of the gravitational wave signal with much greater accuracy.  This will require that matched filter bank based searches employ more matched filters, again demanding more memory and more cycles.

\editorial{This paragraph has too many citations.} Modern gravitational-wave observatories are likely to deliver on the promise 
that their name implies by observing multiple gravitational-wave signals from
compact binary coalescence within the coming decade \cite{kopparapu2008}. 
There is now a world-wide network of gravitational-wave observatories 
including the laser interferometers
\textsc{ligo}, Virgo, \textsc{geo}, and \textsc{tama}, which should assure that coincident detections 
will be possible among at least three separate sites lending confidence
to any detections~\cite{Abbott:2005qm, beauville2008, beauville2006, blackburn2005, LIGOS1instpaper}.  \editorial{This is a lot of citations just to say that the 4 detectors exist.  Maybe if they were scattered throughout the paragraph?}
However, having an electromagnetic or neutrino counterpart to a 
gravitational-wave detection would not only increase the confidence in 
the detection but would also greatly improve the astrophysical information
available from the event.

In a series of detector upgrades that are now under way, \textsc{ligo} and Virgo will become the first advanced gravitational wave detectors, gaining a tenfold improvement in amplitude sensitivity \citeneeded{} and a corresponding thousandfold increase in observable volume in the local universe.  It is anticipated that these detectors will be able to sense as many as 40 events per year \cite{Abadie:2010p10836}.

As the gravitational wave detection horizon pushes outward, the ability to detect signals in near realtime will become valuable.  Having an electromagnetic or neutrino counterpart to a 
gravitational-wave detection would not only increase the confidence in 
the detection but will also greatly improve the astrophysical information
available from the event.  Most models that predict simultaneous
gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations also predict that the
peak amplitude of electromagetic radiation will occur soon after 
gravitational-wave emmission~\cite{sylvestre2003}.  Thus in order to maximize
the chance of a successful electromagnetic followup the latency of 
gravitational-wave signal analysis must be made minimal.

\editorial{This is old news, and doesn't seem relevant to me: EM-directed gravitational wave searches don't benefit from low-latency detection pipelines.} Work has already commenced to trigger gravitational-wave searches from 
electromagnetic observations~\cite{triggeredsearches2008}. \textsc{ligo} observations
ruled out the possibility of GRB70201 originating from the merger of a
\textsc{nsns} or \textsc{nsbh} system in the Andromeda galaxy~\cite{GRB070201}.

In \oldstylenums{2010}, \textsc{ligo} and Virgo completed a period of joint data taking during which several all-sky detection pipelines operated in a low-latency configuration \citeneeded.  Promising detection candidates were promptly sent for electromagnetic followup \citeneeded{} to several telescopes including Swift, \textsc{rotse}, \textsc{tarot}, and Zadko.


This question has been investigated and it seems  at least
possible that gravitational-wave detections could provide a region of the
sky to prompt electromagnetic observation followups~\cite{sylvestre2003}.
\editorial{Cite an in-preparation paper of Larry's?} Much work is currently underway in providing the best possible source 
localization from gravitational-wave detector networks~\cite{markowitz2008, raymond2008, cavalier2006}.  Colloborations are currently forming to provide infrastructure for the gravitational-wave
Astronomers to provide targets of opportunity for electromagnetic 
astronomers~\cite{kanner2008}.  Most models that predict coincident
gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations also predict that the
peak electromagetic fluence will occur soon after 
gravitational-wave emission~\cite{sylvestre2003}.  Thus in order to maximize
the chance of a successful electromagnetic followup the latency of 
gravitational-wave signal analysis must be made minimal.

The parameter space of compact binary coalescence signals is large~\cite{Owen:1995tm, Owen:1998dk}.  It is a
computationally burdensome task to analyze these signals with even moderate
latency~\cite{Abbott:2007xi}.  
This work will describe how to exploit degeneracy in the signal
parameter space to answer more quickly whether or not a gravitational-wave 
is present. Specifically we will explore using the singular value decomposition (\textsc{svd}) to reduce the
effective number of filters required to search the data.  We note that others
have applied the use of \textsc{svd} to gravitational wave data analysis to analyze
optimal gravitational-wave burst detection~\cite{bradyraymajumder2004, heng2008} and coherent networks 
of detectors~\cite{wen2008} .

The paper is organized as follows.  First we provide an overview of the 
standard method for detecting compact binary coalescence signals and
describe how it can be modified to accomodate low latency analysis.  We
then describe the pipeline we have constructed to implement these changes.
To validate the approach we present results of simulations and finish
with some concluding remarks.
