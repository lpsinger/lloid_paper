\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have demonstrated a computationally feasible procedure for the rapid and
even early-warning detection of \GW{}s emitted during the coalescence
of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes. Our method is as fast as
standard \fft{} convolutions but allows for latency-free, real-time
operation.  We anticipate requiring $\sim 4 \times 10 = 40$ modern multi-core computers to
search for binary neutron stars using coincident \GW\ data from a four-detector network.
This is well within the current computing capabilities of the \LIGO{} Data Grid%
\footnote{\url{https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/lscdatagrid/}}.

\CBC\ events may be the progenitors of some short hard \GRB{}s and are
expected to be accompanied prompt \EM{} signals.  Rapid
alerts to the broader astronomical community will improve the chances of
detecting an \EM{} counterpart in bands from gamma-rays down to
radio.

The detection algorithm we described has no intrinsic latency.  However, there are
fundamental and practical latencies associated with the analysis and detection
procedure. For example, the \LIGO{} data acquisition records science data in 1/16~s
blocks~\citep{Bork2001}. Data must also be aggregated from all of the \GW\
observatories using global computer networks capable of high bandwidth but perhaps only
modest latency.  This could introduce a latency of $\sim$100~ms.  Lastly, unless a
real-time infrastructure is adopted post data acquisition, it is likely that there will be 
an inherent latency introduced by the software architecture itself.  We have shown 
prototype implementation of \lloid{} using the open source signal processing platform
\gstreamer. Significant work would have to be done in order to
improve upon the latency of our implementation, including tighter integration between
data acquisition and analysis. This could be considered for third-generation detector
design.
Also possible for third-generation instruments, the \lloid{} method could
provide the input for a dynamic tuning of detector response via the signal
recycling mirror to match the frequency of maximum sensitivity to the
instantaneous frequency of the \GW{} waveform; this challenging technique has
the potential for vast gains in \SNR{} and timing accuracy
\citep{PhysRevD.47.2184}.

% This passage goes in the 'future work' part, but I am having trouble working it in.
\begin{comment}
In the future, this
could be improved upon further by conditionally reconstructing the \SNR{} time-series
only during times when a composite detection statistic crosses a
threshold~\citep{svd-compdetstat}.

Although we have demonstrated a feasible method for advance detection we have
not yet explored triggering, coincidence, and ranking of gravitational wave
candidates in a framework that supports early \EM\ followup.  If adjacent time slices
have non-negligible cross-correlation with each other, then there may be some
subtleties in the design of these postprocessing stages that we must address in order
to translate the early-warning outputs into candidate events.  The time-slice
decomposition and the \SVD\ will help us form low-latency signal-based vetoes
(for example, a $\chi^2$ statistic) that will help us here.

Our future work must more deeply address sky localization accuracy prior to
merger as well as observing strategies. Here, we have followed
\citet{Fairhurst2009} in estimating the area of 90\% localization confidence in
terms of timing uncertainties alone, but it would be advantageous to use a
galaxy catalog to inform the telescope tiling \citep{galaxy-catalog}. Because
early detections will arise from nearby sources, the galaxy catalog technique
might be an important ingredient in reducing the fraction of sky that must be
imaged.  Extensive simulation campaigns incorporating realistic binary merger
rates and detector networks will be necessary in order to fully understand the
prospects for early-warning detection, localization, and \EM\ folluwup using
the techniques we have described.
