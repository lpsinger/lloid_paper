\section{Conclusions}
\label{SECV}\label{sec:conclusions}

We have demonstrated a computationally feasible procedure for the rapid and even preemptive
detection of gravitational waves emitted during the coalescence of neutron
stars and stellar-mass black holes. Our method is as fast as standard \fft{}
convolutions but allows for sample-in-sample-out processing.
Our search targets are expected to
produce prompt electromagnetic signals and may be the progenitors of some short
hard gamma-ray bursts.  Rapid alerts to the broader astronomical community will
improve the chances of detecting an electromagnetic counterpart in bands from
gamma-rays down to radio.  We anticipate requiring $\sim$$10\times4$ modern
multi-core computers to analyze a four-detector network of gravitational-wave data
for binary neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes.  This is well within the
current computing capabilities of the \LIGO{} Data Grid~\cite{LDG}.

The algorithm we described has no intrinsic latency.  However, there are
fundamental and practical latencies associated with the analysis and detection
procedure. For example, the \LIGO{} detectors, data acquisition is synchronized
to a 1/(16~Hz) cadence introducing an up-front latency.  Data
aggregation from the observatories will travel over various networks, each
capable of high bandwith but perhaps only modest latency.  This could amount to
a similar latency of $\sim$100 ms.  Lastly, unless a real-time infrastructure is
adopted post data acquisition, it is likely that there will be an inherent
latency introduced by such infrastructure.  We have shown a prototype
implementation using \gstlal\ that is capable of $\sim$1 s latency. In our
opinion, significant work would have to be done in order to improve upon this
number. For example, a tighter integration of analysis and data acquisition
would be beneficial. This should be considered for third-generation detector
design.

Although we have demonstrated a feasible method for advance detection we have
not explored the accuracy of sky localization that is possible before merger.
Ref.~\cite{Fairhurst2009} discusses some of the theoretical prospects for early sky
localization.  Our future work will explore the prospects of early warning
detection with realistic simulations of binary mergers using the infrastructure
and techniques described here. 

\editorial{Should we mention composite detection?}
\editorial{Yes, although only as something else that we could employ to further reduce compuational cost.}

\editorial{nvf: It's a bit pie-in-the-sky, but we could also mention reconfiguring
the signal recycling mirror to optimize SNR at merger. There's a lot of science there.}
