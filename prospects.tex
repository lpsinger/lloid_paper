\section{Prospects for \earlywarning\ detection and \EM\ followup}

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{\label{fig:earlywarning}Expected number of \textsc{ns}--\textsc{ns}
sources that could be detectable by Advanced \LIGO\ a given number of seconds
before coalescence.  The heavy solid line is the most realistic yearly rate
estimate.  The shaded region represents the 5 to 95\% confidence interval
arising from uncertainty in predicted event rates \citep{Abadie:2010p10836}.}

Before the \GW{} signal leaves the detection band, we can imagine examining the
signal to noise ratio (\SNR{}) accumulated up to that point and if it is
already significant, release an alert immediately, trading \SNR{} and sky
localization accuracy for pre-merger detection.
Figure~\ref{fig:earlywarning} shows projected early detectability rates for
\textsc{ns}--\textsc{ns} binaries in Advanced \LIGO\ assuming event rates
predicted in \citet{Abadie:2010p10836} and anticipated detector sensitivity for
the `zero detuning, high power' configuration described in \citet{ALIGONoise}.
The most realistic estimates indicate that at an \SNR\ threshold of 8, we will
observe a total of 40~events~yr$^{-1}$. $\sim$10~yr$^{-1}$ will be detectable
within 10~s of merger and $\sim$5~yr$^{-1}$ will be detectable within 25~s of
merger if analysis can proceed with near zero latency. These rates are shown
with their substantial uncertainties in Figure~\ref{fig:earlywarning}.

We emphasize that any practical \GW\ search will include technical delays due
to light travel time between the detectors, detector infrastructure, and the
selected data analysis strategy.  Figure~\ref{fig:earlywarning} must be understood
in the context of all of the potential sources of latency, some of which are avoidable
and some of which are not.

\EM\ followup requires estimating the location of the \GW{} source. The localization
uncertainty can be estimated from the uncertainty in the time of arrival of the \GW{}s,
which is determined by the signal's effective bandwidth and \SNR{}
\citep{Fairhurst2009}.  Table~\ref{fig:earlywarning} and
Figure~\ref{fig:sky-localization-accuracy} show the estimated minimum 90\%
confidence area versus time of the loudest coalescence events detectable by
Advanced \LIGO{} and Advanced Virgo.  Once per year, we expect to observe an
event with a final \SNR\ of $\approx$27 whose location can be constrained to about
1300~deg$^2$ (3.1\% of the sky) within 25~s of merger,
260~deg$^2$ (0.63\% of the sky) within 10~s of merger, and
0.82~deg$^2$ (0.0020\% of the sky) at merger.

It is unfeasible to search hundreds of square degrees for a prompt counterpart.
For reference, \textsc{lsst} should see first light around the same time as
Advanced \LIGO{} and will have an unparalleled field of view of 9.6~deg$^2$
\citep{2008arXiv0805.2366I}.  However, 
it is possible to reduce the localization uncertainty by only looking at
galaxies from a catalog that lie near the sky location and luminosity distance
estimate from the \GW{} signal~\citep{galaxy-catalog} as was done in S6/VSR3.
Within the expected Advanced \LIGO{} \textsc{ns}--\textsc{ns} horizon distance,
the number of galaxies that can produce a given signal amplitude is much larger
than in Initial \LIGO{} and thus the catalog will not be as useful
for downselecting pointings for most events. However, exceptional \GW{} sources will
necessarily be extremely nearby. Within this reduced volume there will be fewer
galaxies to consider for a given candidate and catalog completeness will be
less of a concern.  This should reduce the 90\% confidence area substantially.
Proposed third generation \GW{} detectors would improve the \SNR\ and likewise
sky localization.
