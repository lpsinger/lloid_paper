  abstract={A very low latency search pipeline has been developed for the LIGO S6 and Virgo VSR2 science runs, targeting signals from coalescing compact binary systems with total mass from 2 to 35 solar masses. The goal of this search is to provide both single-detector triggers and multi-detector coincident triggers with a latency of a few minutes, the former for online detector monitoring and the latter to allow searching for electromagnetic counterparts to possible gravitational wave candidates. The features and current performance of this low latency search pipeline are presented.}

We also discuss the application of our algorithm to real-data and real-symmetric (discrete cosine) transforms, where we are again able to achieve lower arithmetic counts than previously published algorithms},

  abstract={Gravitational wave (GW) bursts (short duration signals) are expected to be associated with highly energetic astrophysical processes. With such high energies present, it is likely these astrophysical events will have signatures in the EM spectrum as well as in gravitational radiation. We have initiated a program, 'Locating and Observing Optical Counterparts to Unmodeled Pulses in Gravitational Waves' (LOOC UP) to promptly search for counterparts to GW burst candidates. The proposed method analyzes near real-time data from the LIGO–Virgo network, and then uses a telescope network to seek optical-transient counterparts to candidate GW signals. We carried out a pilot study using S5/VSR1 data from the LIGO–Virgo network to develop methods and software tools for such a search. We will present the method, with an emphasis on the potential for such a search to be carried out during the next science run of LIGO and Virgo, expected to begin in 2009.}

  abstract={The T\'elescopes \`a Action Rapide pour les Objets Transitoires telescopes are two robotic observatories designed to observe the prompt optical emission counterpart and the early afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We present data acquired between 2001 and 2008 and discuss the properties of the optical emission of GRBs, noting various interesting results. The optical emission observed during the prompt GRB phase is rarely very bright: we estimate that 5\%--20\% of GRBs exhibit a bright optical flash ( R < 14) during the prompt gamma-ray emission, and that more than 50\% of the GRBs have an optical emission fainter than R = 15.5 when the gamma-ray emission is active. We study the apparent optical brightness distribution of GRBs at 1000 s showing that our observations confirm the distribution derived by other groups. The combination of these results with those obtained by other rapid slewing telescopes allows us to better characterize the early optical emission of GRBs and to emphasize the importance of very early multiwavelength GRB studies for the understanding of the physics of the ejecta.}

  abstract={We present a multiwavelength analysis of Swift GRB 061007. The 2 m robotic Faulkes Telescope South began observing 137 s after the onset of the γ-ray emission, when the optical counterpart was already decaying from R ~ 10.3 mag, and continued observing for the next 5.5 hr. These observations begin during the final γ-ray flare and continue through and beyond a long, soft tail of γ-ray emission whose flux shows an underlying simple power-law decay identical to that seen at optical and X-ray wavelengths, with temporal slope α ~ 1.7 ( F ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} t -α ). This remarkably simple decay in all of these bands is rare for Swift bursts, which often show much more complex light curves. We suggest the afterglow emission begins as early as 30-100 s and is contemporaneous with the ongoing variable prompt emission from the central engine, but originates from a physically distinct region dominated by the forward shock. The observed multiwavelength evolution of GRB 061007 is explained by an expanding fireball whose optical, X-ray, and late-time γ-ray emission is dominated by emission from a forward shock with typical synchrotron frequency, ν m , that is already below the optical band as early as t = 137 s and a cooling frequency, ν c , above the X-ray band to at least t = 10 5 s. In contrast, the typical frequency of the reverse shock lies in the radio band at early time. We suggest that the unexpected lack of bright optical flashes from the majority of Swift GRBs may be explained with a low ν m originating from small microphysics parameters, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} e and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} B . Finally, the optical light curves imply a minimum jet opening angle θ = 4.7°, and no X-ray jet break before t ~ 10 6 s makes GRB 061007 a secure outlier to spectral energy correlations.}

  title={Predictions for the Very Early Afterglow and the Optical Flash},

  number={2},
  pages={641},

  year={1999},
  abstract={According to the internal-external shocks model for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the GRB is produced by internal shocks within a relativistic flow while the afterglow is produced by external shocks with the interstellar medium. We explore the early afterglow emission. For short GRBs the peak of the afterglow will be delayed, typically by few dozens of seconds after the burst. For long GRBs the early afterglow emission will overlap the GRB signal. We calculate the expected spectrum and the light curves of the early afterglow in the optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. These characteristics provide a way to discriminate between late internal shocks emission (part of the GRB) and the early afterglow signal. If such a delayed emission, with the characteristics of the early afterglow, is detected, it can be used to prove the internal shock scenario as producing the GRB, as well as to measure the initial Lorentz factor of the relativistic flow. The reverse shock, at its peak, contains energy which is comparable to that of the GRB itself but has a much lower temperature than that of the forward shock so it radiates at considerably lower frequencies. The reverse shock dominates the early optical emission, and an optical flash brighter than 15th magnitude is expected together with the forward shock peak at X-rays or gamma-rays. If this optical flash is not observed, strong limitations can be put on the baryonic contents of the relativistic shell deriving the GRBs, leading to a magnetically dominated energy density.}

We derive the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) for each problem in the class. We then establish the invariances for the GLR and argue that these are the natural invariances for the problem. In each case, the GLR is a maximal invariant statistic, and the distribution of the maximal invariant statistic is monotone. This means that the GLR test (GLRT) is the uniformly most powerful invariant detector. We illustrate the utility of this finding by solving a number of problems for detecting subspace signals in subspace interference and broadband noise. In each case we give the distribution for the detector and compute performance curves},

  abstract={We carried out a systematic search of precursors on the sample of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by Swift . We found that ~8%-10% of short GRBs display such early episodes of emission. One burst (GRB 090510) shows two precursor events, the former ~13 s and the latter ~0.5 s before the GRB. We did not find any substantial difference between the precursor and the main GRB emission, and between short GRBs with and without precursors. We discuss possible mechanisms to reproduce the observed precursor emission within the scenario of compact object mergers. The implications of our results on quantum gravity constraints are also discussed.}

  abstract={We report on the newly increased event rates due to the recent discovery of the highly relativistic binary pulsar J0737-3039. Using a rigorous statistical method, we present the calculations reported by Burgay et al., which produce a coalescence rate for Galactic double neutron star (DNS) systems that is higher by a factor of 6-7 compared to estimates made prior to the new discovery. Our method takes into account known pulsar survey selection effects and biases due to small-number statistics. This rate increase has dramatic implications for gravitational wave detectors. For the initial Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors, the most probable detection rates for DNS in-spirals are one event per 5-250 yr; at 95% confidence, we obtain rates up to one per 1.5 yr. For the advanced LIGO detectors, the most probable rates are 20-1000 events per year. These predictions, for the first time, bring the expectations for DNS detections by the initial LIGO detectors to the astrophysically relevant regime. We also use our models to predict that the large-scale Parkes Multibeam pulsar survey with acceleration searches could detect an average of three to four binary pulsars similar to those known at present.},
