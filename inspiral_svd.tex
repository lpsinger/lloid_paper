\begin{abstract}
The rapid detection of compact binary coalescence with a network of advanced
gravitational-wave detectors will offer a unique opportunity for
multi-messenger astronomy.  Prompt detection alerts to the astronomical
community may make it possible to observe the onset of electromagnetic emission
from compact binary coalescence.  We demonstrate a computationally practical
analysis strategy that produces early-warning triggers even before
gravitational radiation from the final merger has arrived at the detectors.
With current rate estimates for the Advanced \LIGO{} design configuration, it
should be possible to detect $\sim$10 such sources earlier than 10 seconds
before merger in 1 year of live time using the method we describe.
