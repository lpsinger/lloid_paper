Conventional matched filter bank methods for the detection of gravitational
waves from the inspiral of compact binaries are computationally expensive, have
hundreds of seconds of unavoidable intrinsic latency, and require arrays of
largely redundant matched filters.  Novel detection methods that are more
computationally efficient and have lower latency will be required to realize
the full potential of advanced of gravitational wave detectors that are
currently under construction.  In this paper, we describe a new detection
method that exploits the properties of inspiral waveforms using multi-rate
filtering, principal component analysis, and hierarchical detection.  We
provide receiver operating characteristics from a prototype search pipeline
that is capable of low-latency or near-realtime detection with greatly reduced
computational requirements in comparison with previously described methods.
