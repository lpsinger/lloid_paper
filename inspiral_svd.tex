\begin{abstract}
Conventional matched filter bank methods for the detection of gravitational waves from the inspiral of compact binaries are computationally expensive, have hundreds of seconds of unavoidable intrinsic latency, and require arrays of largely redundant matched filters.  Novel detection methods that are more computationally efficient and have lower latency will be required to realize the full potential of advanced of gravitational wave detectors that are currently under construction.  In this paper, we describe a new detection method that exploits the properties of inspiral waveforms using multi-rate filtering, principal component analysis, and hierarchical detection.  We provide receiver operating characteristics from a prototype search pipeline that is capable of low-latency or near-realtime detection with greatly reduced computational requirements in comparison with previously described methods. Help me!
