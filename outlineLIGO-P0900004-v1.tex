\begin{abstract}
The future of gravitational-wave astronomy permits the possibility that 
gravitational-wave detections from inspiralling compact objects could direct
electromagnetic followup searches. In order to be practical the latency of
gravitational-wave searches informing other astronomical instruments 
would have to be small to catch the peak electromagnetic radiation output. 
It is desirable to consider time domain filters for gravitational-wave data
to reduce the latency.   Typically the cost of time domain convolutions 
is prohibitive for any realizable analysis.  Here we present a method to
make the cost of time domain convolutions reasonable with the hope that it
could be employed for near real time detection of gravitational-wave signals
from compact binary mergers.
